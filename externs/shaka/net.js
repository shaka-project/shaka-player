 *   The delay before the first retry, in milliseconds.
 * @property {number} backoffFactor
 *   The multiplier for successive retry delays.
 * @property {number} fuzzFactor
 *   The maximum amount of fuzz to apply to each retry delay.
 *   For example, 0.5 means "between 50% below and 50% above the retry delay."
 * @property {number} timeout
 *   The request timeout, in milliseconds.  Zero means "unlimited".
 *   <i>Defaults to 30000 milliseconds.</i>
 * @property {number} stallTimeout
 *   The request stall timeout, in milliseconds.  Zero means "unlimited".
 *   <i>Defaults to 5000 milliseconds.</i>
 * @property {number} connectionTimeout
