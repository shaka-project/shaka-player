 * background timers to update the same Manifest object.

 *
 *  INTERRUPTING
 *    const p = parser.start(uri, playerInterface);
 *    await parser.stop();
 *    await p;
 *
 *    |p| should be rejected with an OPERATION_ABORTED error.

 *
 * @property {!shaka.net.NetworkingEngine} networkingEngine
 *   The networking engine to use for network requests.
 * @property {function(shaka.extern.Manifest):!Promise} filter
 *   Should be called when new variants or text streams are added to the
 *   Manifest.  Note that this operation is asynchronous.
 * @property {function(shaka.extern.Manifest)} makeTextStreamsForClosedCaptions
 *   A callback that adds text streams to represent the closed captions of the
 *   video streams in the Manifest.  Should be called whenever new video streams
 *   are added to the Manifest.
 * @property {function(shaka.extern.TimelineRegionInfo)} onTimelineRegionAdded
 *   Should be called when a new timeline region is added.
 * @property {function(!Event)} onEvent
 *   Should be called to raise events.
 * @property {function(!shaka.util.Error)} onError
 *   Should be called when an error occurs.
 * @property {function():boolean} isLowLatencyMode
 *   Return true if low latency streaming mode is enabled.
 * @property {function()} updateDuration
 *   Update the presentation duration based on PresentationTimeline.
 * @property {function(shaka.extern.Stream)} newDrmInfo
 *   Inform the player of new DRM info that needs to be processed for the given
 *   stream.
 * @property {function()} onManifestUpdated
 *   Should be called when the manifest is updated.
 * @property {function():number} getBandwidthEstimate
 *   Get the estimated bandwidth in bits per second.
 * @property {function(string, number, ?number,

 *   Called when an metadata is found in the manifest.
 * @property {function(!shaka.extern.Stream)} disableStream
 *   Called to temporarily disable a stream i.e. disabling all variant
 *   containing said stream.
 * @property {function(string, string)} addFont
 *   Called when a new font needs to be added.
