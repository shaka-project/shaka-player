<!-- NOTE: If you ignore this template, we will send it again and ask you to fill it out anyway. -->

**Have you read the [FAQ](https://bit.ly/ShakaFAQ) and checked for duplicate open issues?**


**If the problem is related to FairPlay, have you read the tutorial?**
<!-- NOTE: https://shaka-project.github.io/shaka-player/docs/api/tutorial-fairplay.html -->


**What version of Shaka Player are you using?**
<!-- NOTE:
  Only some versions of the application are maintained, if your version
  is older, first update to a newer one. See:
  https://github.com/shaka-project/shaka-player/blob/main/maintained-branches.md
--->


**Can you reproduce the issue with our latest release version?**


**Can you reproduce the issue with the latest code from `main`?**


**Are you using the demo app or your own custom app?**


**If custom app, can you reproduce the issue using our demo app?**


**What browser and OS are you using?**


**For embedded devices (smart TVs, etc.), what model and firmware version are you using?**


**What are the manifest and license server URIs?**
<!-- NOTE:
  You can send the URIs to <shaka-player-maintainers@googlegroups.com> instead,
  but please use GitHub and the template for the rest.
  A copy of the manifest text or an attached manifest will **not** be
  enough to reproduce your issue, and we **will** ask you to send a
  URI instead.  You can copy the URI of the demo app to send us the
  exact asset, licence server, and settings you have selected there.
  Avoid geo-blocked content if at all possible, as the contributors who diagnose
  Shaka Player issues may not be able to access it.
  If you send the URIs to email, the response time and resolution
  will be much higher.
-->


**What configuration are you using?  What is the output of `player.getNonDefaultConfiguration()`?**
<!-- NOTE:
  You can censor URLs to keep them private, but include them in the email.  You
  can also use JSON.stringify(player.getNonDefaultConfiguration(), null, 2) to
  print nicely on platforms that don't print objects well in the console.
  DON'T SEND '[object Object]'!
