/* Special styles for input elements with type "range".
 *
 * These elements are composed of two main parts: a "track", which is the
 * horizontal bar, and the "thumb", which is the knob which slides along that
 * bar.
 *
 * In order to style the track across browsers (cough, IE 11), we need to do
 * something a bit tricky.  Styling the track is a nightmare, especially if you
 * want the thumb to be larger.  On IE 11, this gets clipped at the track size.
 * So a tiny track with a large thumb is not easily achieved.  It can be done,
 * but the techniques for it are incompatible with the gradient background we
 * want to apply to it.
 *
 * The solution is to put the input inside a div container, and apply the
 * background gradient styles to the container.  The container will act as a
 * visible, virtual track, inside which is contained a larger, invisible track,
 * in which is contained a visible thumb.  This way, the thumb is not larger
 * than the actual track (for IE 11's sake), but can be larger than the virtual
 * track.  And since we are still using a semantically correct input element,
 * the element is inherently accessible. */
