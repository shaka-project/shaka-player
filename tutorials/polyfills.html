Polyfills
</h3>

<p>
A {@link https://remysharp.com/2010/10/08/what-is-a-polyfill polyfill} is a bit
of code that fills in missing APIs or normalizes variations in APIs. A polyfill
allows other pieces of code to expect a single API from the underlying browser.
</p>

<p>
The Shaka Player uses polyfills to modify, rename, or replace various pieces of
browser functionality.  Before instantiating the Player, these polyfills should
be installed into the JavaScript environment.
</p>

<p>
Each polyfill has its own class and a static install() method.  We suggest that
you install all polyfills, since the install method will intelligently detect a
browser's capabilities and only patch APIs which need patching. The recommended
method is {@link shaka.polyfill.installAll}.
</p>

<p>
Once browsers commonly implement the necessary functionality consistently, some
polyfills can be removed to reduce the size of the JavaScript code.
</p>

For detailed information on our polyfills, please see: {@link shaka.polyfill}
