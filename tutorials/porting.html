Philosophy
</h3>

<p>
Shaka Player does not attempt to detect the browser vendor or version. Instead,
we target certain standard or standards-track features and support the browsers
that implement those features.  Where necessary, we use polyfills to supplement
native browser support on a case-by-case basis.
</p>

<p>
See the <a href="tutorial-polyfills.html">Polyfills tutorial</a> if you are not
already familiar with the term.
</p>


<h3 class="tutorial-heading">
Required Features
</h3>

<p>
Some features are required for basic operation.
<ul>
  <li>HTML5 video
  <li>MediaSource Extensions (MSE)
  <li>Promises
  <li>Uint8Array
  <li>CustomEvent constructor
    <ul>
      <li>polyfill provided to fall back on createEvent and initCustomEvent
    </ul>
</ul>
</p>


<h3 class="tutorial-heading">
Optional Features
</h3>

<p>
Some features are optional, but enable the library to do more when present.
<ul>
  <li>Encrypted Media Extensions (EME)
    <ul>
      <li>required only for protected content
      <li>EME v0.1b polyfill provided for Chrome &lt; 42
      <li>no-op polyfill provided for browsers without EME
    </ul>
  <li>IndexedDB
    <ul>
      <li>required only for offline storage and playback
    </ul>
  <li>WebVTT
    <ul>
      <li>required for subtitles
    </ul>
  <li>getVideoPlaybackQuality
    <ul>
      <li>used by the library to collect QoE stats
      <li>polyfill provided for webKit prefixed version
      <li>no-op polyfill provided for browsers without
    </ul>
  <li>fullscreen API
    <ul>
      <li>not used directly by the library, but useful for app developers
      <li>polyfill provided to unify major browser implementations
    </ul>
</ul>
</p>


<h3 class="tutorial-heading">
Testing for Support in an Application
</h3>

<p>
To test for browser support in an application:
<ol>
  <li>Load the library.
  <li>Install all polyfills via {@link shaka.polyfill.installAll}
  <li>Test for support via {@link shaka.player.isBrowserSupported}
</ol>
</p>


<h3 class="tutorial-heading">
Debugging Browser Support
</h3>

<p>
We provide a support test page in the sources. This page does not rely on Shaka
Player itself, and can be used as a standalone tool without compiling the code.
Load support.html to see a detailed report for your browser. We host the latest
release version of this page {@link http://goo.gl/RMTEGZ here}.
</p>

<p>
This support report is a great place to start debugging browser support issues,
and you should include it in any bug report about browser support. You can find
the source for this report in {@link https://goo.gl/2MU5E0 support.js}.
</p>


<h3 class="tutorial-heading">
Adding Support with a New Polyfill
</h3>

<p>
If you want to add support for a new browser via a new polyfill, please file an
{@link https://goo.gl/nR24qY issue on github} to track the work and discuss the
implementation with us if need be.
</p>

<p>
A polyfill should only implement, patch, or rename one feature.  In some cases,
such as EME, this may be {@link https://goo.gl/jQgMeg large} with many parts to
it.  In other cases, it may be a {@link https://goo.gl/baWIE8 fallback} to some
equivalent functionality using a different API.  But please do not try to write
a single polyfill to tackle many missing features at once.
</p>
